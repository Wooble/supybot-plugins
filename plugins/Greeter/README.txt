This is the Greeter plugin, designed to introduce the bot and the channel to newcomers. It should have a short greeting in channel (configurable) with a more detailed message privmesg to the individual. Also should be able to repeat the introduction at request.

It should track what nicks it already has seen and ignore varations.  (nick w/ multiple _).
