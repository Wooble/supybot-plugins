These directories contain plugins for supybot from three places:

* Everything in the "Supybot-plugins-20060723" directory comes from 
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/supybot/.  
* The ones in the "edsu-plugins" directory come from plugins Ed 
  Summers wrote for his supybot.  
* The ones in "plugins" were written locally, and consist of minor 
  variations on the built-in plugins, which can be viewed at
  http://rc98.net/built-in_supybot_plugins/.

Anyone with write privileges to this repository should feel free to
edit any plugin, and any plugin from the built-in that you wish to
override should be created in the "plugins" directory.  Newly created 
plugins should also go in "plugins".
