These directories contain plugins for supybot from three places:

* Everything in the "Supybot-plugins-20060723" directory comes from 
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/supybot/.  
* The ones in the "edsu-plugins" directory come from plugins Ed 
  Summers wrote for his supybot.  
* The ones in "plugins" were written locally, and consist of minor 
  variations on the built-in plugins, which can be viewed at
  http://rc98.net/built-in_supybot_plugins/.

Anyone with write privileges to this repository should feel free to
edit any plugin, and any plugin from the built-in that you wish to
override should be created in the "plugins" directory.  Newly created 
plugins should also go in "plugins".

Don't have write privileges and think you should?  Ask an admin; we're happy to include people who've established some history in the community.  If you've not done that, please start hanging around the [mailing list](https://listserv.nd.edu/cgi-bin/wa?SUBED1=CODE4LIB&A=1) or [IRC channel](http://code4lib.org/irc).
